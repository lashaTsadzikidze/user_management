# User Management System

This project is a Django-based application for managing users. It provides features such as user registration, login, and CRUD operations for managing user accounts. It includes a role-based permissions system where admins can assign users to specific groups (`default` and `mod`) with predefined permissions.

## Features

- User registration and authentication.
- Create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
- Admin dashboard for managing users and permissions (requires superuser privileges).
- Role-based permissions:
  - `default` group: Add posts and view posts.
  - `mod` group: Add posts, delete posts, and view posts.
